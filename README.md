## Creating a TODO LIST project using react with react-routerv6.6

I'm trying to learn the new react router version 6.6. It gives elements or formerly components super power to work with data using new data routers.
#### New Data Routers include
- createBrowserRouter 
- createHashRouter 
- createMemoryRouter 
- RouterProvider 

These allow elements to get data through the lorder functions and manipulate the data using action function. I call this super power functionality of react-router. Saving us from the pain of droping hooks everywhereðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ
